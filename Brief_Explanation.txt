The provided code sets up a real-time audio classification application using a GUI created with Tkinter. It captures audio using PyAudio, processes it with Librosa, and uses a pre-trained neural network model from TensorFlow to classify the audio into different genres. The classification results and the audio waveform are displayed in real-time using Matplotlib plots embedded in the Tkinter GUI.

Here's a step-by-step summary:

Import Libraries: Imports Tkinter for the GUI, Librosa for audio processing, PyAudio for audio capture, Numpy for numerical operations, Matplotlib for plotting, and TensorFlow for loading the neural network model.

Initialize Root Window: Creates the main Tkinter window.

Control Variables: Defines global variables to manage the audio stream state.

Custom Deserialization Functions: Defines custom initializers needed to load the neural network model.

Load Pre-trained Model: Loads the neural network model with custom initializers.

Placeholder for Predictions: Initializes an array to hold genre prediction probabilities.

Start and Stop Functions: Functions to start and stop the audio stream.

Set up Frames: Creates frames in the Tkinter window to hold plots.

First Plot: Sets up a Matplotlib plot to display genre prediction probabilities.

Second Plot: Sets up a second plot to display the audio waveform and Mel spectrogram.

Prediction Function: Processes the Mel spectrogram to predict genre probabilities and updates the prediction array.

Set up Canvas for Plots: Embeds the Matplotlib plots in the Tkinter frames.

Arrange Frames: Positions the frames in the Tkinter grid layout.

Set up Audio Stream: Configures the audio stream using PyAudio and selects the appropriate input device.

Create Start and Stop Buttons: Adds buttons to the GUI to control the audio stream.

Set up Animations: Uses Matplotlib's FuncAnimation to periodically update the plots.

Run Main Loop: Starts the Tkinter main loop to run the application.

Cleanup: Ensures the audio stream is properly closed when the application exits.

The code utilizes a custom-trained 2D CNN model for music genre classification, which is likely trained on Mel spectrogram features extracted from audio signals. The custom initializers ensure that the model weights are correctly restored during loading. The architecture and specifics of the model, while not explicitly provided, typically involve several convolutional layers followed by pooling and dense layers to perform the final classification.
